If you publish results that have been derived with the help of this software, I would appreciate a reference to the original paper describing the application:

Application of a Bayesian Method to Absorption Spectral-Line Finding in Simulated ASKAP Data. 
Allison J. R., Sadler E. M., Whiting M. T.,  2012, PASA, 29, 221

To run you will need a local working copy of pymultinest (https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest) and the MULTINEST libraries.

Further documentation to be added.
